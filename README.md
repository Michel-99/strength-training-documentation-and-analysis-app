# strength-training-documentation-and-analysis-app

Hi this is my first Streamlit app. 
I wrote this app so that i can document my strength training better. 
The input screen is conected to a DETA.sh database where I store the session data. 
The output screen/Analysis screen can be used to look up the last session with currently two monitoring parameters. 
One Monitoring-parameter is relative load and the other is for the mean barebell weght that is being moved. 
I plan to update and improve the Analasys/output screen in the future.
